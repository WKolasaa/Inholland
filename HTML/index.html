      <h3>Halo</h3>
      <p>The Halo is a protective barrier that helps to prevent large objects and debris from entering the cockpit of a single-seat racing car. There are specific rules for its construction, and the device is manufactured by three approved companies for the F1 teams to then add to their racing cars.</p>
      <p>The F1-spec Halo is made from strong, lightweight titanium tubing, which is then attached to the car’s carbon fibre chassis at three points for maximum rigidity. The system adds around 9kg to the car’s weight.</p>
